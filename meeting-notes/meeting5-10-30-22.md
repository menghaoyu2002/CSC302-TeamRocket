## Next steps:

- initial react start project: Menghao ~ PR by Tuesday/Wednesday + scripts to run
- implement design: Basic layout Jeremiah ~ PR by Thursday Friday
- styling: Michael ~ PR Friday to weekend
- deadline: next week

- update documentation
  - talk about abstracting database setup for tests and how to use: Menghao
  - requirements.txt
  - more detail on project and features
- blameless postmortem
- Assignment writeup: Jeremiah

## Compromises:

- must display at least 1 visual (1 pie chart or line graph)
- ideally: multiple countries on one graph
- worst case: put one line per graph to represent one country
